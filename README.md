# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis using Quadratic Programming

I made use of the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer Database to train a model to determine
if an unknown tumor sample is malignant or benign. I implemented a MATLAB program to
identify a hypothesis function by minimizing a quadratic cost function over the training set.
